# Study: Blacklight Search UX

An evaluation of the default [Blacklight ](https://projectblacklight.org/)search interface, branded for [CRKN's Canadiana collection](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/about-canadiana-collections), was conducted in late 2024. The aim was to identify usability issues and enhance the user experience as CRKN transitions from the existing [Canadiana Access Platform (CAP)](https://www.canadiana.ca/) to a new Blacklight-based system. This section summarizes the findings from usability testing involving diverse target groups, including genealogical researchers, GLAM professionals, and post-secondary students.
