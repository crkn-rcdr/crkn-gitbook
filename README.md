# Study: Blacklight Search UX

## Introduction

An evaluation of the default [Blacklight ](https://projectblacklight.org/)search interface, branded for [CRKN's Canadiana collection](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/about-canadiana-collections), was conducted in late 2024. The aim was to identify usability issues and enhance the user experience as CRKN transitions from the existing [Canadiana Access Platform (CAP)](https://www.canadiana.ca/) to a new Blacklight-based system. This section summarizes the findings from usability testing involving diverse target groups, including genealogical researchers, GLAM professionals, and post-secondary students.

## Object of Evaluation&#x20;

The object of evaluation was the default Blacklight search interface, with CRKN-Canadiana branding applied, carried out in late 2024 by the CRKN team. See the figures below.&#x20;

## Evaluation Method&#x20;

This test was conducted as an unmoderated think aloud usability test with the online usability testing software, [Maze](https://maze.co/). As this was an unmoderated usability test, the users were not observed live while they carried out the tasks. Instead, their interactions with the website and their verbal comments were recorded for later analysis. Users were recruited from our voluntary pool of existing Canadiana users, as well as a group of seminar students from a university level history course. &#x20;

Each participant individually carried out tasks on the Canadiana-Blacklight website during their usability test session. At the end of their usability test session, the participants answered a [System Usability Score (SUS)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/system-usability-scale?srsltid=AfmBOorRvc7DE1V7HG-WOUK0L-lC3DzARvOXSOfh545IKjQVvfiEfZBw) questionnaire of pre-defined questions and had the opportunity to submit any comments in a final open-ended question. Subsequently, the captured video recordings were analyzed by the author. The evaluation is based on an analysis of these videos from 24 unmoderated usability test sessions. The total time for each usability test session including answering questions was less than 30 minutes.&#x20;
