# Study: Blacklight Search UX

## Introduction

An evaluation of the default [Blacklight ](https://projectblacklight.org/)search interface, branded for [CRKN's Canadiana collection](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/about-canadiana-collections), was conducted in late 2024. The aim was to identify usability issues and enhance the user experience as CRKN transitions from the existing [Canadiana Access Platform (CAP)](https://www.canadiana.ca/) to a new Blacklight-based system. This report summarizes the findings from usability testing involving diverse target groups, including genealogical researchers, GLAM professionals, and post-secondary students.

## Object of Evaluation&#x20;

The object of evaluation was the default Blacklight search interface, with CRKN-Canadiana branding applied, carried out in late 2024 by the CRKN team. See the figures below.&#x20;

## Evaluation Method&#x20;

This test was conducted as an unmoderated think aloud usability test with the online usability testing software, [Maze](https://maze.co/). As this was an unmoderated usability test, the users were not observed live while they carried out the tasks. Instead, their interactions with the website and their verbal comments were recorded for later analysis. Users were recruited from our voluntary pool of existing Canadiana users, as well as a group of seminar students from a university level history course. &#x20;

Each participant individually carried out tasks on the Canadiana-Blacklight website during their usability test session. At the end of their usability test session, the participants answered a [System Usability Score (SUS)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/system-usability-scale?srsltid=AfmBOorRvc7DE1V7HG-WOUK0L-lC3DzARvOXSOfh545IKjQVvfiEfZBw) questionnaire of pre-defined questions and had the opportunity to submit any comments in a final open-ended question. Subsequently, the captured video recordings were analyzed by the author. The evaluation is based on an analysis of these videos from 24 unmoderated usability test sessions. The total time for each usability test session including answering questions was less than 30 minutes.&#x20;

### Task 2

**Instructions:** Show 100 items per page in the search

**Expected answer:** The users were expected to move below the search bar and locate the drop-down component, which indicates the current number of items displayed in the search results. They were then expected to click this component, which would open the full list of values: 10, 20, 50, and 100 items. Then, they were expected to click the last item, 100, which would reload the search page with 100 results in the first page of the search listing.

### Task 3

**Instructions:** Sort the search by newest to oldest

**Expected answer:** Users were expected to move towards the right side of the page, below the search bar, to find the search sort options. They were then expected to click the drop-down menu which indicated the current search sorting selected, “Sort by relevance.” Then, a full list of values including “Sort by relevance” and “Sort by newest to oldest” would be displayed to the user. Then, they were to click the “Sort by newest to oldest” option which would reload the page in this order.

### Task 4

**Instructions:** Show only items written in the Ojibwa language&#x20;

**Expected answer:** The participants were expected to navigate to the facet listings in the left-hand menu on the search interface, titled “Limit your search.” They were then expected to locate the “Language” facet. Then, they were to click the facet title, which would open an expansion panel listing the first twenty values alphabetically, and a “more” indicator. Users were then to notice “Ojibwa” was not in the first twenty values and click “more.” Then, a pop-up window was expected to appear, where the users could see an alphabetical, paginated list of values for the Language facet. The pop-up model also included options for sorting the listing alphabetically, or numerically, by most popular values. Finally, the full-value listing pop-up had “previous” and “next” buttons for navigating through the search results. As “Ojibwa” would be somewhere in the middle of the list of languages available to choose from, users were expected to click the “next” button three times, until they saw “Ojibwa” listed in the values. Then, users were expected to click “Ojibwa” which would close the pop-up and filter the search results on “Language” -> “Ojibwa.”&#x20;

### Task 5

**Instructions:** Browse all the items about Arctic Regions&#x20;

**Expected answer:** The users were expected to navigate to the “Subjects” facet in the left-side “Limit your search” menu in the search interface. Then, they were expected to click the “Subjects” heading, to expand the list of values, this time, sorted numerically by most popular subject. Users were expected to scan the listing and see that “Arctic Regions” was not in the top 20 values shown in accordance with the sort order. Then, users were expected to click “More,” which would open the full listing of values for “Subject,” and click “next” once to find the “Arctic Regions” subject listed. Finally, they were expected to click the “Arctic Regions” value, which closed the pop-up and filtered the search results by “Subjects” -> “Arctic Regions.”&#x20;

### Task 6

**Instructions:** Find all the items by the Royal Society of Canada&#x20;

**Expected answer:** The users were expected to navigate to the “Limit your search” left hand side menu, and find the “Creator” facet heading, and click the heading to expand the list of the top twenty values sorted numerically by popularity. This time, users were expected to see the “Royal Society of Canada” in the top twenty values. Users were expected to click the “Royal Society of Canada” value, which would then filter the search results on “Creator” -> “Royal Society of Canada.”&#x20;

### Task 7

**Instructions:** View the items published from 1800-1850&#x20;

**Expected answer:** Participants were expected to navigate to the “Limit your search” menu and find the “Date Range” facet. They were then expected to click the “Date Range” facet heading, to expand the default listing, which lists increments of 200 years from year 0 to the current year, as well as two inputs for entering a custom “from” and “to” range, and finally, an “Apply” button to initiate the custom-date-range filtered search.  Noticing that the required date range is not a 200-year interval, users were expected to enter “1800” in the “from” input, and “1850” in the “to” input, then press “Apply” to initiate the filtered search. Then, the search results filtered on the “Date Range” -> “1800-1850” were expected to be displayed.&#x20;

### Task 8

**Instructions:** Remove all applied filters&#x20;

**Expected answer:** Users were expected to move the cursor below the search box, to the section that lists all the applied facet values.

#### User Comments

> Add a description (or little help explanation pop-up) of what main page search is searching when one selects Title vs Subject vs All Text vs Etc.

> I want more detail on the resources that could be searched.&#x20;

> Add a filter by type of source (such as peer reviewed journal)&#x20;

> It would be very good if it included more archives, museum catalogues, and library resources.&#x20;

> More content. This is a great service. It helps me greatly with subjects that interest me. The more resources that could be added the happier I would be. Keep up the great work!

> If digitized microfilm files could have more than just image 1, image 2, etc. It would be so nice if for each new file to have something that indicates "new file, or file page."&#x20;

* [Task 5](./#task-5)&#x20;
* [Task 6](./#task-6)&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Insights</summary>



* During task 1, 16.67% of users noticed the field drop down box beside the search bar and took interest in it.
* During task 5, 45.8% of users ended up searching for the target topic using the search bar instead of going to the facets menu to look for a subject, with 63.64% of those users also using the field selector drop down to select “subject” with the search bar. &#x20;
* During task 6, 37.5% of users ended up searching for the target author using the search bar instead of going to the facets menu to look for the author, with 44.44% of those users also using the field selector drop down to select “author” with the search bar.&#x20;
* During task 1, a user was momentarily confused by pressing enter not triggering a search.&#x20;

</details>

#### Recommendations

* Ensure "all fields" is the default option for the search field drop down selector.&#x20;
* Ensure that when the user presses enter, a search is initiated.&#x20;

### Search Results Count Selector

<details>

<summary>Related Tasks</summary>

* [Task 2](./#task-2)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Insights</summary>

* 100% of users experienced confusion with there being no loading indicator on the screen when the search is initiated (in this case, by selecting 100 as the # of results to display, which takes a few seconds.) Users incorrectly assumed the display count functionally was not working during this time.

</details>

#### Recommendations

* Add a loading indicator on the search page that displays when the page sends a request to the back end for search results. This could be triggered by any of the sorting options, the display count, or when entering new search terms or facets.

* 95.65% of users immediately moved their mouse to the correct interface element. The location of this functionality was very user friendly.&#x20;
* 21.38% users noted that oldest to newest was most important for their workflow.&#x20;

</details>

#### Recommendations

* Ensure "oldest to newest" is an option listed in the sorting options.

### Selected Filters Section

<details>

<summary>Related Tasks</summary>

* [Task 8](./#task-8)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Insights</summary>

* During Task 8, 16.67% of users did not notice the selected filters section at the top of the screen instead they used the x button beside each selected value listed under a facet in the “Limit your search” facets side menu.
* During Task 8, of the users who did see the section, only 30% of them engaged with or used the reset search button.
* During Task 8, of the users who did not see the section, 50% of users clicked the highlighted facet headers that had selected values within them to try to clear the values within the facet.

</details>

#### Recommendations

* It may be beneficial to have a “clear selected values” functionality within each facet's expansion panel to remove all selected values for a facet in one button press.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Insights</summary>

* During Task 5, 37.5% of users did not immediately go to the “Subject” facet to look for a topic of interest.
* During Task 5, 16.67% of users first assumed the “Collections” facet would contain thematic or topical collections and clicked this facet to search for the target value.
* During task 6, 16.67% of users missed the target value in the expansion panel for the facet, indicating usability issues for finding items in the top values list.
* During Task 6, 12.5% of users first assumed the “Collections” facet would contain thematic or topical collections and clicked this facet to search for the target value.

</details>

#### Recommendations

* Make facet lists easier to scan by adding dividers, adding spacing between values, or reducing the number of values listed if possible (without triggering the more interface, see the next component section for more information.)
* Ensure your facet labels are easy to understand and differentiate. For example, CRKN can reflect on their use of the term “collections” for describing the format-based grouping (serials, monographs, etc.) as this is not immediately intuitive to all users. Possible alternatives could be “format” or “material.”

### Facet Pop-ups

* he task success rate drops 25% when facet pop-ups are necessary to complete the task. For example, Task 6, where the target value could be found under the expansion panel for a facet, there was a success rate of 75%, whereas Task 5, where users were expected to find the target value on the second page of the listing within the facet pop-up, had a success rate of 50%. These tasks both involved large listings (thousands) of possible values for the facets, which makes them a good comparison. Success rates of 50% and 75% for both tasks indicate a poor experience and/or use case for facets with many (thousands) of values.&#x20;

- During Task 4, even with a 100% task completion rate and fewer total values (< 100 options), 25% of users verbally indicated frustration at needing to navigate a paginated list of values instead of being able to see all the values for the facet directly after pressing more. &#x20;

* During Task 4, 25% of users, took longer than ideal to become aware of the existence of the pagination buttons in the pop-up. &#x20;

- During Task 4,16.67% of users did not notice the pop-up right away and were not expecting their attention to need to shift to the center of the page after clicking more. &#x20;

* During task 5, 33.33% of users sorted listing alphabetically when looking for a specific value, even when the value was on the second page within the listing on the pop-up. &#x20;

- During task 5, 45.8% of users ended up searching for the target topic using the search bar instead of going to the facets menu to look for the subject, with 63.64% of those users also using the field selector drop down to select “subject” with the search bar. &#x20;

* During Task 5, 16.67% of users abandoned the task entirely when needing to use the facet pop-up, due to frustration.&#x20;

- During task 6, 37.5% of users ended up searching for the target author using the search bar instead of going to the facets menu to look for the author, with 44.44% of those users also using the field selector drop down to select “author” with the search bar.&#x20;

</details>

#### Recommendations

* Redesign needed – do not use them in their current state if possible.&#x20;
  * A temporary solution is to set the default before there being a “more” function to the count of your largest facet.
  * Do not rely on the search facets for displaying all the metadata values you want your users to be made aware of. Use facets sparingly and to support common filter experiences for users, such as date and language.  For supporting exploratory experiences or topical listings, instead design an index with alphabetical navigation as a separate experience. Label the page “Explore our collection by topic” or similar. &#x20;
  * To make it easier to explore from the search results, a field listen in an item can be turned into a clickable link. When users click on this link, they will be directed to a search page that displays all items matching that specific field value. For example, if an item lists their subject, that could be a clickable link, which gives a search result matching all items with that subject.&#x20;
  * A good example of a more user-friendly facet interface, which solves both the pain points experienced by the users is the [Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada Archives.](https://iccc-archives.andornot.net/list?q=\&p=1\&ps=20) (ICCCA)&#x20;
    * The ‘More’ button loads more values directly into the facet listing&#x20;
    * The ‘Explore’ button loads a pop-up with a search box and alphabetical navigation&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-05 104559.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 6: The explore function loads a pop-up which better meets the needs of users – allowing them to more easily find a specific value through both search and alphabetical navigation.

* From additional user comments throughout the tasks, it was noted that it was not immediately obvious to users if a result in the search listing was a series of items or an individual item.
  * Some users indicated they would imagine each listing result to be a single item.
  * Some users expressed surprise when clicking an item in the search results led them to a set of items instead of an individual book, newspaper, etc.

- Some users assumed bilingual cataloguing meant the item itself was bilingual.

</details>

#### Recommendations

* Ensure that the distinction between a series and an individual item is clear to users, so they understand that they will encounter different page designs based on the item type.

## Closing Statement&#x20;

In conclusion, the usability evaluation of the Blacklight search interface identified important areas for improvement. While users generally found the interface intuitive, challenges such as missing loading indicators and issues with facet pop-ups were evident. By addressing these concerns and implementing usability enhancements, we can significantly improve the search experience and ensure a smoother transition for users familiar with the existing CAP system. Additionally, adopting an open-source and community-driven approach will enhance usability not just for Canadiana users, but also for other institutions utilizing Blacklight-powered search systems.&#x20;
